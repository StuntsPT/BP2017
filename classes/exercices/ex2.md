# Class 2 exercices

Once again, the first thing to do is download the data we are about to use. In this case it is a data table with the colours and size categories of "Magic beans".

Link 1 - [Magic beans data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StuntsPT/BP2017/master/classes/exercices/Magic_beans.csv).

1. Take a look at the data using any spreadsheet software (this time it should be quick). 

## 1. Data loading, basic statistics and plots

1. Load the data from the URLs provided above into R. Variable names are up to you from now on. But please, make them *descriptive*. Your future you will thank you.

2. Make a bar plot of the size distibuition. Make sure the bar widths match the size category.
Hint: check out the "?table" function for category counting.

3. Make a bar plot of the colour distribution. Ensure the colours match.

## 2. Hypothesis tests

1. All colours of "Magic beans"" are supposed to be produced in equal porportions. What does teh data suggest? Perform a tests to assess this. Describe H0.

2. Since H0 was rejected in (1), test which colour(s) is (are) out of porportion.

3. Consider only <font color="red">red</font> magic beans. Are size categories equally distributed?
Hint: Check out th North vs. South rivers example for ideas on how to filter your data.

3. Does the colour of the bean influence its size? Or are size and colour independent? Describe H0.
